To run this project...

You will need 2 terminals and a browser.

In the first terminal window, navigate to the root directory and run the following
  `./run_django.sh`

In the second terminal window, navigate to ./client and run:
  `ng serve`

You should now have the django API running in the first window on port 3000 and the angular app running in the second window on port 4200.

Navigate to localhost:4200/posts to view the application
